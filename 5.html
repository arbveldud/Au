Sometimes you just get … in a mood, and the best way to alleviate the giddiness that comes with needing an outlet for potentially destructive pent up laughter is a good, old-fashioned prank.</p> <p> No need to wait until April to get your gag on, here are the top ten practical jokes and pranks. </p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <strong> 10. The salt shaker</strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> One person’s passé is another person’s classic. Never has this well-worn adage (actually, I think I just made it up) been more true than with this practical joke. Best when used at a restaurant so more people can take part in the fun, simply loosen the top of the salt shaker, leaving the lid sitting on top. Then sit back and try not to giggle; that’s a sure sign something’s up.</p> <p> <strong> <span> 9. The eyebrow</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> Want to target a heavy sleeper? After she’s out for the night; and when she’ out she’s really out, a simple razor and a touch of shaving cream is all you’ll need. The key to pulling off this little caper is shaving just the one. In the morning, there’s a decision to make; shave off the other one or try to make do with one real and one fake? What a dilemma.</p> <p> <strong> <span> 8. Face painting</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> This is not often used in conjunction with item #8 on our list, as that crosses the bounds of jokes and pranks and enters the realm of downright mean, though we do need another heavy sleeper. Grabbing the nearest eyebrow pencil, lipstick and other assorted marking gear, proceed to play dress up on the face of the unsuspecting, comatose patsy. For the adventuresome among you, a black marker will work and is close to permanent. Naturally, this takes it up a notch or two.</p> <p> <strong> <span> 7. Shaving cream</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> Here’s a final one to play on the folks crazy enough to fall asleep without the foresight to adequately protect themselves, and it’s fairly painless too. To do this properly takes at least two people; one to prepare the sleeping person’s hand with a load of shaving cream prior to tickling their face, and another to film it all. The latter of the two should also be familiar with how to quickly post the results on YouTube and other social media outlets. </p> <p> <strong> <span> 6. Icy Hot</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> Horribly cruel and not just a little physically painful, this one’s included on all high school and college lists of jokes and pranks. When your target (in other words a freshman) isn’t looking, apply a layer of Icy Hot to the inside of his jock strap. Now, if you’ve never seen the results, here’s the good part. Usually a good 10 to 15 minutes elapses while the Icy Hot is working it’s magic, and they BAM! It’s easy to tell who the victim of this prank is; he’s the one sprinting to the locker room screaming bloody murder.</p> <p> <strong> <span> 5. Saran Wrap</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> There’s a reason they call some jokes and pranks classics; they continue to stand the test of time. Securing a layer of crystal clear saran wrap over the toilet bowl, beneath the lid, is a sure fire way to get the guests rolling. The homeowner, or whoever ends up being responsible for the clean up may be less than enamored, but that’s their problem.</p> <p> <strong> <span> 4. Honkin’ huge spider</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> Spiders are the bane of most everyone’s existence, as well they should be. NOT being afraid of big old hairy spiders should be a phobia, not the other way around. This prank works best when placed in a room that requires a light be turned on upon entry. Then, assuming it’s placed in such a way it is immediately and unmistakably forced into the face of the target (hanging from the ceiling with fishing line for example), it will have the machoest of men screaming like a 6-year old girl.</p> <p> <strong> <span> 3. Bathroom door swap</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> Okay, this one’s a beaut, and can be enjoyed by the masses. Choosing an opportune moment, slide the Ladies and Mens signs off their respective doors in the bar or restaurant of your choosing. Phase two of this dastardly plan entails swapping them. Phase three is as simple as sitting back; making certain to adjust your seat for optimum viewing, and watch the fireworks.</p> <p> <strong> <span> 2. Shopping cart madness</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> I haven’t actually performed nor been the victim of this one, just a variation or two. But as soon as I heard about it I knew; this is gooooood. Many of us are put out by those inconsiderate folk that think nothing of leaving their shopping cart in the middle of an aisle and meandering off. Next time, take the opportunity to throw several items in their cart, or at least as many as you think you can get away with. They do it again? You do it again. It’ll be worth waiting for them at the checkout line, oh yeah.</p> <p> <strong> <span> 1. Whoopee cushion</span> </strong> </p> <p> <br/> <br> </p> <p> It’s a sound no one likes to hear, no one wants to hear and very few can suppress at least a giggle when they do hear. Yes, the Whoopee Cushion remains at the top of any and all lists of jokes and pranks. Naturally, catching the most rigid, uptight person among a group is the ideal. In fact, the snootier the better; you wouldn’t believe it possible for a person to actually turn that shade of red. Take it from me; it is, and I did. </p> <span> <i> </i> </span> jokes , pranks Share <i> </i> Facebook <i> </i> Twitter <i> </i> Pinterest <i> </i> Linkedin <h2> Post navigation</h2> What are traditional harvest times Best of holiday china for entertaining <h2> Related Posts </h2> <h2> History of Valentine’s Day Why is it the Day of Love </h2> <span> <i> </i> February 11, 2021 February 11, 2021 </span> <h2> 5 Must-Read Books Of All Time That Everyone Should Read </h2> <span> <i> </i> February 4, 2021 February 4, 2021 </span> <h2> Why is Mardi Gras Celebrated History and Traditions </h2> <span> <i> </i> January 21, 2021 February 4, 2021 </span> <h3> Leave a Reply Cancel reply </h3> <h2> Archives</h2> Archives Select Month February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 January 2020 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 <h2> Recent Posts</h2> History of Valentine’s Day Why is it the Day of Love Kid Safe Cooking Tools To Get Them Excited To Cook 5 Healthy Foods That Will Boost Your Mood Happiness 5 Must-Read Books Of All Time That Everyone Should Read Refresh Your Wardrobe for Spring <h2> Tags</h2> accessories art Business children christmas clothing college cooking Crafts decor decorating dogs Education exercise fashion food furniture games garden gardening gifts Health history holiday holidays Home home decor jewelry kids kitchen marriage party pets recipes safety school shoes Shop Sports ten top Travel Valentines Day wedding winter <h2> Categories</h2> BUSINESS &amp; FINANCE B2B Office Supplies Celebrate CELEBRATIONS &amp; ENTERTAINING Party Ideas &amp; Stationery Weddings &amp; Invitations CULTURE &amp; ENTERTAINMENT Books, Music &amp; Movies Computers &amp; Electronics Religion &amp; Spirituality Education, Entertainment &amp; Culture FASHION &amp; BEAUTY For Her Beauty &amp; Cosmetics Clothing Plus Size Clothing Womens Health &amp; Fitness For Him Clothing Big &amp; Tall Clothing Men Health &amp; Fitness For Home Computer &amp; Electronics Garden Yard Pool Green &amp; Organic Home Decor Home Improvements Home Office Kitchen &amp; Housewares Pet Supplies Religion &amp; Spirituality Rugs &amp; Flooring For Kids Education &amp; Supplies GIFTS &amp; SHOPPING Food &amp; Gourmet Gifts Gadgets &amp; Guy Stuff Gifts &amp; Collectibles HEALTH &amp; FITNESS Green &amp; Organic HOBBIES &amp; SPORTS Art Hobbies Crafts Dance Cheer Gym Sports &amp; Recreation HOME &amp; GARDEN Garden Yard Pool Home Decor Lifestyle Transportation, Travel &amp; Recreation TRAVEL &amp; TRANSPORTATION Cars, Trucks, Cycles &amp; RVs Outdoor Enthusiast Travel &amp; Vacations <h2> Meta</h2> Log in Entries feed Comments feed WordPress.org <span> All Rights Reserved 2020.</span> <br> Proudly powered by WordPress <span> | </span> Theme: Refined Magazine by Candid Themes . <i> </i><br>
